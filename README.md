# Vocabulary Learning and Quiz Application

A modern, full-stack web application for learning and testing vocabulary skills with an interactive user interface and persistent score tracking.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development through vibe coding methodology. The entire application was built collaboratively using GitHub Copilot for code suggestions and Claude Haiku 4.5 as the primary AI model for architecture decisions, component design, and problem-solving. 

Only 1% of the codebase was written manually, with the vast majority generated through intelligent prompting and iterative AI collaboration. This approach showcases how modern AI tools can dramatically accelerate development cycles while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity.

## Project Status

This project is still in progress. Current implementation includes:
- Fully functional frontend with React 19 and TypeScript
- Complete user interface with responsive design
- API integration layer with error handling
- Two learning modes (flashcards and MCQ quiz)
- Score tracking and leaderboard system
- Comprehensive SCSS design system with tokens

Planned future enhancements:
- Backend integration testing with live data
- Additional vocabulary categories and difficulty levels
- User authentication and profiles
- Advanced analytics and progress tracking
- Performance optimization and caching strategies

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite 7.3.1 for build and development
- SCSS with CSS custom properties for styling
- Axios for HTTP communication

### Backend Requirements
- RESTful API endpoints for data management
- Vocabulary data storage
- Score and leaderboard persistence
- User session management

## Key Features

- **Flashcard Mode**: Interactive card flipping interface for passive vocabulary learning
- **Multiple Choice Mode**: Scored quiz mode with immediate feedback
- **Score Tracking**: Automatic persistence of scores to leaderboard
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface (90% width on screens < 500px)
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with Poppins and Inter fonts
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant correctness validation during quizzes
- **Leaderboard**: Display of high scores and top performers

## Development Methodology

### Vibe Coding with AI

This project was developed using a vibe coding approach where:
1. Requirements and features were specified through natural language prompts
2. GitHub Copilot provided intelligent code suggestions and completions
3. Claude Haiku 4.5 handled complex architectural decisions and debugging
4. Iterative refinement through AI-assisted problem-solving
5. Minimal manual code writing focused on fine-tuning and direction

## License

This project is part of the Vocabulary Learning and Quiz application suite.
